## <a name="issues"></a>Issues and Bugs

### Where to Find Known Issues

We will be using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jotform/dnd-builder/issues) for our public bugs. We will keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesn't already exist.

### Reporting New Issues

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case. CodeSandbox provide a way to give live examples.


## <a name="pr"></a>Pull Requests

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

*Before* submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is doneâ€¦

+ Search [GitHub](https://github.com/jotform/dnd-builder/pulls) for an open or closed Pull Request that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.

+ Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
+ If you've added code that should be **tested**, add tests!
+ If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
+ Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`).
+ Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`) - we've done our best to make sure these rules match our internal linting guidelines.
+ Write visual tests for new features by adding them in the `stories` directory. Run storybooks (`yarn storybook`) and check out changes.


## <a name="code"></a>Code Guide

Our linter will catch most styling issues that may exist in your code.
You can check the status of your code styling by simply running: `yarn run lint`

However, there are still some styles that the linter cannot pick up.
### Code Conventions

* Use semicolons `;`
* Commas last `,`
* 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
* Prefer `'` over `"`
* 100 character line length
* Write "attractive" code
